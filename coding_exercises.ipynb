    "2.\tAuthentication & Authorization\n",
    "    + Ensure only the right users can access certain features or data.\n",
    "    + Example: Login systems with strong password policies.\n",
    "3.\tData Protection\n",

    "4.\tError Handling\n",
    "    + Don’t expose internal system details in error messages.\n",
    "    + Example: Show generic error messages instead of stack traces.\n",
    "5.\tSecure Dependencies\n",
    "    + Use trusted libraries and keep them updated.\n",
    "    + Vulnerabilities often come from outdated packages.\n",
