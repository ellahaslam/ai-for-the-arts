The purpose of this repository is to learn how to use these tools introduced to me in this course and pull them into a portfolio.
My goals for this course include: 
+ Learning how to utilize different tools like Github and Copilot.
+ Learn basic Python code syntax and semantics.
+ Reflect critically on Notebook exercises and AI assistance.
+ Get a good grade in this course

## My Repository  
+ **Created a coding notebook** where all my coding exercises were tested and reflected on. 
    + **coding_exercises.ipynb**
    + **Created a LLM notebook** where I presented an idea for an application showcasing the interaction between humans and AIs: **LLM_Applications.ipynb**
+ **Completed a Machine Learning notebook** where I reflected on ML and learned about the ML workflow– step by step. 
    + **Machine-Learning-by-Examples-from-start-to-end (1).ipynb**
